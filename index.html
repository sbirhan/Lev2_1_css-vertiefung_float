    <h1>Steve Jobs</h1>

    <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, 
        chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, 
        iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology. Born in 1955 to two University 
        of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of 
        college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left 
        the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died 
        in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg</h1>

    <p>
        Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American internet entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is known 
        for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
        He also co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot.
        Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room on February 4, 2004. An earlier inspiration for
        Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. 
        It published its own student directory, “The Photo Address Book”, which students referred to as “The Facebook”. 
        Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, 
        students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.
